""" ----------Find missing number in range N to 1 Using XOR----------
Problem
>>> Given an array of n-1nâˆ’1 integers in the range from 1 to N, find the one number that is missing from the array.

NOTE: This solution prevents interger overflow !

Example:
Input: 1, 5, 2, 6, 4
Answer: 3 """
# NOTE: Time complexity => O(N)
# NOTE: Space complexity => O(1)


def find_missing_number(arr):
    n = len(arr) + 1
    # find sum of all numbers from 1 to n.
    s1 = 0
    for i in range (1, n+1):
        s1 += i

    # subtract all numbers in input from sum.
    for i in arr:
        s1 -= i
    
    # s1, now, is the missing number
    return s1

def main():
    arr = [1, 5, 2, 6, 4] # expected output = 3
    print('Missing number is: ' + str(find_missing_number(arr)))

main()
