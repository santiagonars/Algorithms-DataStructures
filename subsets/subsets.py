""" --------Subsets (easy)--------
Problem Statement #
>>> Given a set with distinct elements, find all of its distinct subsets.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 3]
Output: [], [1], [3], [1,3]

Example 2:
Input: [1, 5, 3]
Output: [], [1], [5], [3], [1,5], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3] """
# NOTE: Time complexity => O(N * 2^N) ,where â€˜Nâ€™ is the total number of elements in the input set. 
#                       => Since in each step the number of subsets doubles as we add each element 
#                       => to all the existing subsets, therefore there are O(2^N) subsets.
#                       => A new subset is constructed from an existing set, resulting in O(N * 2^N).
# NOTE: Space complexity => O(N * 2^N) , for any additional space used by the algorithm is for the output list.
#                        => Since we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, and each subset can take up to O(N) space.
